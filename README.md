# snapchat_message_analysis
A project that creates statistics from exported snapchat message histories.

Have you ever wondered how long your average texts are?
What the most commonly used words are in your messages?
What the longest messages you've ever sent are?
Who you text most often, and how much you text them?

This project answers all of those questions, and more.
